        <h5 style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>goal #1: fix the plastic problem</h5>
            <p>
            My best guess on how to achieve this is to evolve known plastic-eating bacteria to become more efficient.
            One problem here is that the bacteria Ideonella sakaiensis can only break down PET and cannot break down the plastic completely.
            I want to create a warehouse of machines that iteratively grow and select the best plastic-eaters. This would be a machine similar to the <u><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2013.021">Morbidostat</a></u>.
            I'm looking for people with skills, labor, and funding. If you are a biologist, chemist, or roboticist, contact me.

        <h5 style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>goal #2: invent neural search engine</h5>
        <p>
    My best guess on how to achieve this would involve recieving input by reading brain signals associated with handwriting <u><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03506-2.epdf?sharing_token=8UZkdjO-Zgm-em7rdp7lC9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0No0Kktd9EUuDWeYWONAJ_7c9Vh-4dwWbu73lNBtR0SQDxcHwumbmBTtIhwAjVK86JKifJnIgD0u1IgsIG3u863nE1l4GspSUzHWMbu7_hIgV8IIxs7UKhA0JZsEanQFB2cM60_8bUCiqCRoDKKkaXNAr-HuUD-LzKs55JM62kU5MwFwkPk1Rct7MfSUllIrZIrG5NOvEMZjIULDs6lbmNT8ZZIT6vUSJK8JVbY8GLx0xhq8X8JhCcMOkgnpXqQsN63uHE519N94afEI3hMIzrUG_qCsviAqYi8CepU_95nmg%3D%3D&tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com">(already achieved)</a></u> and outputting the results to the brain via the primary visual cortex <u><a href="https://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-xv-prosthetics/introduction-to-visual-prostheses-by-eduardo-fernandez-and-richard-normann/">(some progress)</a></u>.
    The brain would be used as a sort of bootloader; browsing the web through a simple interface consisting of motor input ("keyboard") and visual output ("monitor").
    This is a very difficult goal. I will have to work along hundreds of others.
    If anyone is attempting to solve this problem and needs an programmer/ML specialist/cognition enthusiast, contact me.
