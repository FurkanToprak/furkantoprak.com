      "the childhood curiosity of being the übermensch: GIVE TO THE CHILDREN",
    content:
      "# GIVE TO THE CHILDREN\n\n \n\nI will quickly discuss my thoughts on many children’s curiosity towards themselves. As children reach adolescence but still can use their imagination with great ease, they start a sort of prayer: some internal, psychic incantation that they may one day realize that they are superhuman, advanced, and the most effective and hopeful generation of offspring yet. \n\n \n\nThis curiosity was historically either uncommon or unsustainable by maturation, but thrives in the modern world of innovation, absolutism, humanitarianism, and liberalism. My observations, however, seem to have generally and especially have held true in the past century and even more so in the last half-century. \n\n \n\nRemaining on the original topic, let us discuss how this pertains to children: Depending on the nature and indoctrination of that child, the wish may come in many guises. \n\n \n\nFor example, religious children may wish they are the second messiah, the returning hero, the chosen one, the Phoenix, the son of god, the demigod, the son of christ, the favorite slave of Allah, the Dalai Lama, the next prophet, the subject of divine inspiration, destined achiever of Nirvana, et cetera. \n\n \n\nThose children indoctrinated by fascist, empirical, or nationalist agendas might be inclined to hope to find themselves themselves as “the national savior”, “Hitler’s Youth”, progeny of the “Great Leap Forward”, recipients of the Mandate Destiny, exploiters of the American Dream, the moral conqueror, the rightful King of the World, the national corrective offspring that will regenerate their society’s ancient prosperity myth. \n\n \n\nLastly, I should point out the multiplying number of children who, under the postmodern and pseudo-nihilistic age, may see themselves as “the generation that took advantage  of the fact that, as Nietzsche solemnly stated, ‘God is Dead’”. While this was, ironically, definitely not seen as an advantageous development by Nietzsche, I suppose that is neither here nor there. It would also be unviable to not point out that many postmodernists (also perhaps ironically), adopt some new heuristic as they are molded by life- often some aesthetic ideal that matures to become a non-religious religion - that serves as an often impractical, non-universal, arbitrary truth (with a lower-case ‘t’). \n\n \n\nAll of these examples, of course, are a small subset of the universe of possible narrative proclivities which are uncountable in number though generalizable to some practical degree of resolution. In other words, the whole of possible ideological proclivities are greatly variable in a predictable number of dimensions.\n\n \n\nMoreover, that sort of feeling, which I suppose every child had in varying degrees and intensities, that feeling of hypnosis; that sense of wonder originating with the child’s engrossment with applying her ever-developing, seldom understood, and inevitably-skewing ethos, pathos, and logos to process and understand the visceral, novel, all-encapsulating stimulus she finds herself in. \n\n \n\nMy thesis is, I propose that we dedicate considerable resources in fostering, preserving, and monitoring the expectations of these children. We must invest in childhood nutrition, ethics, and accessibility and equality of opportunity; this is an only natural progression of development in the history of the human race. Algorithms and structures that we’ve used to organize our society set the “rules” of our games. Not increasing the population ceiling and number of niches of our games seems to be an ad hoc arbitration that threatens the development and sustainability of the game. Not teaching the future participants the rules of the game, along with methodologies to find new, better rules seems like a short-term, greedy oversight that stifles all of the progress achieved by the old men who planted all the trees.\n\n \n\nWe _cannot_ afford to be naive in our maintenance of our games and our trust in them; in other words, this is the prosecution of corruption and the pedagogy of ethics. Trust is a prerequisite resource to the most valuable human behavior- cooperation. As things are, there remains little basis to place trust between the impoverished and the affluent. We cannot hide or run away from each other- the planet is small and crowding. Without the prosperous trusting (and this is no blind trust- just see the UN’s analyses) that the impoverished contain high levels of potential and goodwill to contribute to the wellbeing of all humans, there will be no trust towards the affluent by the impoverished.\n\n \n\nWe must set up institutions that feed humans until the age of 18, at the very least. This will allow children to stay in school instead of working to stay fed or- worse- starving on the streets. All schools should provide free breakfast, lunch, and dinner to every child who cannot be fed or fed with difficulty. A non-trivially manipulative but most definitely justifiable manner byproduct of this, will be rejuvenated generations devoid of health and behavioral issues arising from malnutrition, less time spent scavenging a mere subsistence, and more time spent en masse educating, enriching, and empowering future generations. Schools must turn into piazzas, fostering a culture that encourages students to spend day and night there. Schools must be given resources to develop programs of teaching skills, advanced classes, and fostering discussion. In a way, the school must replace what the library, monastery, and medrese was. This is doubtless expensive, but a field that is lucrative, advantageous, and very easy to bring in real talent and innovation from public, charitable, and corporate entities.\n\n \n\nThese are some financially powered methods of providing a thriving pool of useful brainpower, checks and balances on fascistic or anarchistic tendencies that occur in bitter individuals withheld appropriate opportunities, lower levels of poverty and crime (as creativity is embraced constructively instead of being unleashed destructively), and a rejuvenated bond of mankind. \n\n\n\n",

    title: "a vaguely informed theory on beauty and art",
    content:
      "I believe beauty is an ideal, found in establishing meaning between different elements of life; these elements may consist of values, aesthetics, and displays of understanding - in nature and in self. These meanings, as can be seen in comedy, literature, propaganda, war, self-deception, false suppositions propagated by ignorance or sincerity or - worse yet - insincerity, and the anacronyms of fools, do not have to necessarily reflect truth and reality; in fact, all it must do is inspire feelings of emotion- satisfactory, agreeable or not. Undoubtedly it is, of course, absurd to expect art to reflect “nature”, “God”, or “good”. In fact, many pieces of art are unnatural, heretical, nihilistic, ironic, or even malignant; let it be noted that these standards of judgement change with respect to innumerable variables and are in no sense universal.\n\nIt is even, in a sense, sufficient to limit the explanation of art and beauty through biology- though you would be foolish to do so beyond the purpose of understanding the cognitive mechanics of art. Our brains have evolved to detect patterns, be emotionally responsive to sensual and ideological input, and find subjective meaning in stimuli. Our best evolutionary feature yet, which without we may have been starved from the pleasures, wisdom, and perceptions of art, is the homo sapiens’ tendency to establish narrative around meaning and experience. It is, in a sense, the stories our prototypical instincts draw around artwork and life that allows us to find our meaning in life and beauty in an innumerable amount of things.\n\nMany theories have been propagated in the modern era that art is just another form of play for man. While this may have once been true (likely in pre-agrarian eras, if at all), mankind has insistently turned art into a motivation, reward, and a socio-economic tool. Then, while the biological basis of explaining art is valuable, it would be very insincere, dangerous, untrue, and utterly inhumane to view arts as solely a mammalian instinct similar to the play-fighting of lion cubs, the games of dolphins, or the wrestling of infant rats. Due to the cognitive advancements, imagination, and psychological depth that humans have developed over thousands of years, art and beauty must be upheld and learned like morality, exercise, and knowledge.\n\nI make these statements and hold these convictions after having read the following books:\n\n* Leo Tolstoy’s “What is Art?”,\n* Viktor E. Frankl's “Man’s Search of Meaning”,\n* Jordan Peterson’s “Maps of Meaning”,\n* Dante Alighieri’s “Inferno”.\n\nI am eager to hear your opinions and am also probably incorrect.\n\n*FT*",

    title: "On Confusion",
    content:
      'In recent days I have taken no pleasure from this human experience. I cannot be sure, but I believe this is beyond some simple manifestation of nihilism or some ill wish against life - I am in every sense confused. I am disoriented, helpless, and inexplicably sad.\n\n\nLately, I cannot distinguish the ideal of goodness from the arbitrary aesthetics I hold. I know this to be false, but I somehow cannot convince myself of this. I cannot erase this dirty suspicion that perhaps I am to blame for this. It is as if all morals I had held- and all those that should be held- were some forgotten whisper I once heard in the womb. The nauseating irony is that my name means "he who distinguishes right from wrong."What a cruel, blunt, tasteless joke!\n\n\nIs this desire to be constantly self-consistent, this contempt for myself, this loathing of human limitation yet another aesthetic? Is it some fascistic insistence that I should be free from fault? Why does my existence feel so primally frustrating? What grand conspiracy is acting against me that I should be so burdened by my own faculties? Is it my ignorance, naivety, curiosity, or cowardice that has produced this sickening impulse to know everything?\n\n\nI have been attempting to absorb information at a dizzying pace- it has now become this arduous chore to scan page after page from an increasing number of books; all in the hopes that somewhere I have missed this small secret of the universe that should make me understand; Even more foolishly, I have also been looking for secrets that could make me less miserable or even happy.\n\n\nToday a comforting thought dawned on me for the first time in a long time: that I cannot think of a conceivable reason to live without an optimistic outlook. To live believing I am doomed only for misery would be an insult to my human spirit. What use is there in living in such depths of gloom if I am the one who has consented to my own fortune?\n\n\nI know I must not betray my past self and actions; It is only fair to judge yourself by your capacity. The cruel compromise I have reached is something that any reasonable person would have easily reached: I will live the best I can.\n\n*FT*',
